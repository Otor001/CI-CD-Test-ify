//Triangles can be classified based on the length of the sides relative to one another. 

//If all the sides of  triangle are equal, that triangle is called Equilateral triangle

//If ONLY TWO sides of the triangle are equal, that triangle is called Isosceles triangle

//If NONE of sides of  the triangle are equal, that triangle is called Scalene triangle

//Write a Javascript program that prints the name of the triangle based on the length of the sides in relation to one another.


// Print Equilateral triangle if all the sides are equal

// Print Isosceles triangle if only two the sides are equal

// Print Scalene triangle if only none of the sides are equal

const side1 = 1, side2 = 2, side3 = 2;

const day = 'Thursday'
if (side1 === side2 === side3) {
    console.log("This is an Equilateral triangle")
}
else if (side1 === side2 || side1 === side3 || side2 === side3) {
    console.log("This is an Isosceles triangle ")
}
else{
    console.log("This is a Scalene triangle")
